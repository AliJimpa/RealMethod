### The Pitch
`RealMethod` is a minimal architectural framework for Unity. It provides a small, explicit structure for organizing game lifetime, world context, and systems, inspired by **Unreal Engine** concepts such as `GameInstance` and `GameMode`.

`RealMethod` is designed to help programmers build and maintain scalable Unity projects by enforcing clear ownership and predictable lifecycles. It favors simplicity and clarity over abstraction and avoids heavy frameworks, dependency injection containers, or hidden execution flows. `RealMethod` focuses on structure, not gameplay, and does not attempt to replace Unity workflows.

`RealMethod` is particularly suited for games and real-time applications where long-term maintainability matters: indie and studio projects, system-heavy games, tool-driven workflows, and projects that must evolve over time without architectural collapse.
* Clear ownership and responsibility
* Unreal-like mental model for Unity
* Minimal core, flexible edges
* Scales from small games
* experimental for productions
* Team-friendly and testable architecture
